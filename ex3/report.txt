Started the program with a breakpoint at the start of search and started stepping through it.

When the program got past the part of not finding the value and into the part of setting a new edge
we saw that the wrong side got a new index.
For values larger then the middle the right side got an index lower then the middle.

So changing the check from less then to larger then it works.
It was validated with a small for loop to check that all values are found.
