Started the program with a breakpoint at the start of search and started stepping through it.

When the program got past the part of not finding the value and into the part of setting a new edge
we saw that the wrong side got a new index.
For values larger then the middle the right side got an index lower then the middle and the reverse for lower values.

So changing the check from 'less then' to 'larger then' fixes the issue.
It was validated with a small for loop to check that all values are found and not only worked for
some specific values.
